# Hisaab API

**Hisaab API** is a backend service for managing shared expenses. Built with Flask, MongoDB, and JWT-based authentication, it allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete expense entries while keeping track of who owes whom. The API also includes user registration, login, and registration code generation features.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and secure routes using JWT tokens.
- **Expense Management**: Create, view, update, and delete expense entries.
- **Access Control**: Restrict update and delete operations to the user who created the entry.
- **Registration Codes**: Generate and validate registration codes for user sign-up.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enabled for all routes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB
- Pipenv or virtualenv (optional but recommended for managing dependencies)

### Setup & Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asdhamidi/hisaab-api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
